| About the Application:                                      |
| ScheduleBuddy is an application that is designed to make    |
| viewing and managing appointments easy. ScheduleBuddy isn't |
| just an appointment management application, however. Yes,   |
| you will be able to view, add, update, and cancel           |
| appointments but you can also view, add, update, and        |
| delete customer records. Reporting is also available in the |
| application. You may view records by week, month, and year. |
| You may view records by contact and customers as well.      |
| With these capabilities security is extremely important.    |
| Your data is password protected.                            |
